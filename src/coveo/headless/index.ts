/*
* TODO: Need to update the @coveo/headless package to the latest version later when they fix the following issue. The current version is ^2.33.0
* After adding the @coveo/headless package I started getting a warning during webpack compile like "WARNING in ./node_modules/@coveo/headless/dist/browser/headless.esm.js 18:422-429
Critical dependency: require function is used in a way in which dependencies cannot be statically extracted"
* Feedback from Coveo:
* This is a side effect of including polyfills in the coveo/headless package. Right now, this is caused by a polyfill for the crypto package that we cannot unfortunately remove at the moment.
However, this will be addressed in the next major release of headless for which I cannot provide any ETA.
